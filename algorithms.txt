Alternative Algorithms for To-Do List Manager

Algorithm 1: List-Based Approach
- Load CSV into a Python list of dictionaries.
- For any change, overwrite the CSV with the list contents.
Pros: Simple, easy to implement.
Cons: Not efficient for very large datasets.

Algorithm 2: Dictionary/ID-Based Approach
- Use unique IDs as keys in a dictionary and update specific rows.
Pros: Efficient, easier single-row updates.
Cons: More complex to implement for beginners.

Chosen Algorithm (for this project): Algorithm 1 (List-Based Approach)
Reason: Simpler for a single-user console project and ideal for step-by-step learning.
