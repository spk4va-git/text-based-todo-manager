Problem Statement: Text-Based To-Do List Manager

In everyday life, individuals often need a simple way to record, track, and manage their tasks. 
This console-based program will allow the user to add tasks, view pending tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.

Requirements:
1. Add a new task with a description.
2. Persist tasks so they are available after the program closes.
3. Display tasks showing completed and pending status.
4. Mark tasks completed.
5. Simple text-based UI accessible via screen reader.

Storage: CSV file (tasks.csv) for simplicity and portability.

This project is a practice exercise for Python basics, file handling, error handling, and version control (Git/GitHub).
